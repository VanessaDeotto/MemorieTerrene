Over the past thirty years, the urbanization advance has been a serious threat to peripheral territories. Those territories where life has continued as if time had not passed, away from the needs and modern conjectures that the capitalistic’ system imposed on the world. The attraction to the modern world, however, has led large masses of people to abandon their places in search of a new life, far from the land. In the North-East of Italy, located on the Alps, there exist a territory that hardly still resists the looming threats of abandonment: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nJqa2S7ZS8D7Sfs68" >Carnia</a>. Its forest and headlands, has always characterized it as a severe and hostile territory, where life flows intensively among the uncontaminated nature. A rural territory, rich on traditions that have been settled into the land, a secular symbol of nourishment and, a hard community who have learned to live with their environment in a symbiotic and unique relationship. In thirty years the population number suffered a decline of 12,500 inhabitants, which inevitably led to an aging of the total population. Depopulation means abandonment of houses, villages, lands, infrastructures, traditions, stories, practices, seeds, gestures, and way of living that has characterized the past and the present of the territory. The only possible solution to revive these territories is to remain, deciding to do not leave, or to arrive believing in the potentials that the territory offers. To remain, also means, to bet on those territories that have been part of the soul of past people, to pursue a lifestyle that is in concordant with the territory and, to fight for and with the territory against the homologate capitalistic world that makes of humans and nature an insignificant part of the whole system led by the few. Re-inhabiting these lands would mean believing in a community capable of uniting for the good of the entire territory. But how to encourage the act of remaining?

      <h6><i> PROJECT PURPOSE</i></h6>
<p>

   

The reflections and interviews done during the semester lead me to consider the land as the core of my project topic. But why land? Land is what stands below us, it is at the base of our entire life. It is what gives nourishment to humans, plants, animals and other living beings, characterizing a territory, a community and their stories. Returning to the land would mean giving it back importance, reconsidering the role of being/working/living with the land. Carnia is rich in lands, which can still be defined uncontaminated. Its inhabitants established their lives on those lands, building houses, bridges and roads and feeding on woods and fields. Moreover, every tradition, proverb, story or practice is embedded in the past agricultural world, when the land was all they had and what is remained in a depopulated territory. In the land, I see the power to encourage the act of remaining, questioning our current way of living and restoring something that draws in the past but that has a vision on the future of our territory. Returning to the land would mean increase respect toward nature and the other-than-human beings, but also would lead to cooperate among humans in order to reach the same purpose. My intention, therefore, is to praise the Carnia’s land through the collection of witnesses, experiences and visions of the past, present and future of our land, placing them in an experiential archive. Entering or experiencing the archive means to have a deep understanding on what lands represent for Carnia from agriculture to forest and handcraft. 
Through the archive, I would like then to trigger discussions about the power of the land in encouraging the act of remaing, and to create sharing moment where people can experience the archive and the community in an intergenerational and diverse people network.

      <h6><i>PROJECT CHALLENGE</i></h6>
<p>


The archive made with and for people aims to a total community involvement. Inspired from the figure of Cramars, I will travel around the villages collecting material from the community spread throughout the whole territory, in order to have a direct interaction with them in their “private” context. During an ongoing pandemic this could be the first main challenge to deal with. A second step would be to imagine and create the Archive image with a co-creative workshop with groups of citizens. Giving to it the possibility to shape itself temporary and materially in different ways for different purposes. The archive, in fact, should be both temporal and permanent, physical and digital made of tangible and intangible elements. More than anything else, the archive should be as open and self-sufficient as possible to give people the possibility to direct intervene in modifying it without any constraints. Moreover, people should want to enter the archive to acquire knowledge, to give something, or/and to have and create new visions on the present and future of the territory. This would lead to create an interactive space where people can discuss and suggest new ideas, visions, perspective, practices, gestures, stories, witnesses. Finally, through the use the archive I would like to engage a series of events and workshops which brings people, also from other realities, together creating so a cohesive network which also looks out from the territory boundaries. This will be one of the main challenges, to bring often harsh, skeptical and traditionalist community to see beyond their own home walls to finally let them be carried away by new ideas and approaches.

       <h6><i> ECO-SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION</i></h6>
<p>


The project outcomes will be able to enhance an eco-social transformation of the territory. First of all, on a social level, the community will be able to express their opinion concerning the future of its land. For instance, bringing people together will lead to create a cohesive network made of different actors and realities who cooperate for a common purpose, instead of collide. Regrets and envy, in fact, must be left behind in order to focus on the present. 
On an environmental level, bringing a natural element, the land, at the core of the discussion will encourage to reconsider nature as a precious and unique system to protect and, why not, to imitate it, considering its “multispecieness” habitat. At the same time, the archive will point out a “new” sustainable way of living that draw in the past, but that is well rooted in the present context. One of the goals of the project is also to bring agriculture in the everyday life of the community, aiming to reach a basic self-sufficient alimentation, creating a bond with the local seeds and varieties. 
On a macro level, concerning the impacts, the community involvement will lead to attract the politicians’ attention who will finally listen to the needs of the population, and maybe to create new territorial regulations. Lastly, considering what gave rise to the project, people will begin to remain or to arrive in Carnia, gradually repopulating the high lands. With the last hope that it can become a replicable example for many similar contexts where mountains and humans live in close contact.
